# World Weather Analysis

## Project Overview

In this analysis we will be using APIs to collect weather and travel destination data for our client Jack. We will use the OpenWeatherMap API to collect our weather data and we will use the Google Maps API for our location and hotel data. The project is broken up into three sections. In the first section, we will collect weather data for a series of random cities and store them in a csv. In the second section, we will add in a hotel for each of our cities then create a markup map for every one of our cities along with pop ups with descriptive information. Finally, we will select a vacation itenerary of four cities in a single country and create a route for the vacation. We will also display a markup map for these four cities.
